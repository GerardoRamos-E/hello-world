# hello-world
This is practice for me to learn how to navigate Github. 
I'm a Mechanical Design Engineer by day working in the jet propulsion industry.
Prior programming / coding experience I've had was working on Arduino projects during my college years (~9 years ago).
Looking to learn some programming just to expand my skillset and potentially come across new opportunites.
